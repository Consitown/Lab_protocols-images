took the coated cylinders out of the scaffholding (see images)
one issue: thickend pait at the ends off the cylinders (see images) --> might interfere with measurements

took the coated fibres out of the holding (see images)
issue one - paint sticks holding together --> difficult to loosen up the holding and release the fibres
issue two - paint at the end of fibres is very wavy --> might interfere with measurements

wrapped the cylinders and fibres in aluminium foil (prevent dust from laying down)
