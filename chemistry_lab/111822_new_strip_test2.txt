this time with multiple layers of tape
first: inspaction of now dry strip --> looks just as two days prior (not the quality we want)

tried to use the lab tissues as protection from holding (see images) --> still stuck to paint (I reckon it wasn't dry enough yet, although the layer of paint is extremly thin there)
cut off a really long piece of tape (approx 40 cm) and wrapped it around the other end (the uncoated one) off the strip (see images)
	- was able to wrap it around 5-6 times (exact number not important)
coated the end+10cm at 21.1Â°C
success: 	the tape managed to hold off the paint. The first layer was curled as before, second layer was also affected by paint,
		third layer was practically unaffected, fourth layer and so on unaffacted --> my reccommendation: at least three layers
the border of paint to tape obviously not crystal clear. reason is the viscosity of the paint --> when taking off the tape it stuck to it and there were threads just like with hot glue
(see images)

hanged the strip for drying. Instead of the usual holding I used tape (see images) --> possible to hold the small unaffected end really stable
--> If there are no or few remainders (which I think I could clean off in the worst case), I propose using tape as holding also for coating

next thing to try: double coating --> reapply tape and hit the edge perfectly (well, try to)
