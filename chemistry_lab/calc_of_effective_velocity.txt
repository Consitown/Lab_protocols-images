some stats from 06092022_VerdrÃ¤ngung:

height gain per cm immersed = 0.035 cm
NOTE:	height gain per cm immersed != height loss per cm withdrawn: when the cylinders are withdrawn, paint sticks to them resulting
	in a effective loss of paint volume --> fill height before and after coating are different
	BUT: gain in immersion and loss by withdraw are about the same

due to the height gain: If one immerses at 1 cm/s --> effective 1.035 cm/s immersion speed.
				--> 1.035 cm/s=62.1 cm/min=621.00 mm/min
max speed of coater: 150 mm/min=15 cm/min=0.25 cm/s
			--> every 4 s, one additional cm is added
			--> effective vel=(0.25+0.035/4) cm/s=0.25875 cm/s=155.25 mm/min
