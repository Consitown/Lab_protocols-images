preperation for fibres:

got additional screws for the holders of the fibres
fibres couldn't be stretched to max, since the holders are imperfect + I don't have a 3mm allen key (InbusschlÃ¼ssel)
stuck together some kind of scaffholding (it literally only holds the whole thing)
cleaned the fibres with VE water and antistatic plastic cleaner
--> wait for discharge under fume
--> maybe coat tomorrow
