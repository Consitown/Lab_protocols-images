made a mistake: 	Put the freshly coated holding on a paper towel --> paper towel got stuck
			this may very likely influence the paint if coated again --> need to clean
cleaning attempts:immersion in water+isopropanol : still waiting for effects
			immersion in pure isopropanol : effective, one still needs to scrap off the remaining paper, but that much is doable

- cleaned the cylinders with VE water and the antistatic platic cleaner using paper towels and not the Labort√ºcher.
	Discharging them under the fume till tomorrow
