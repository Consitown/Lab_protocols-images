the polysterene-strip (only strip hereafter) for Christophe wasn't polished on one end --> gave it back to Maik
--> he polished it, while not even losing 1mm of material
proceeded to clean to strip thoroughly:
	VE water for first layer of dust and to expose other impurities
	Isopropanole for fat and other organic substances
	anti-static plastic cleaner for final layer of dust
--> let it stay under the fume over night to discharge
next: use of pressurized air

got the second delivery of Kremer: Isopropanol and Paraloid B72

had to admit that I coated the fibres in the wrong paint. New setup of fibres will take a while
