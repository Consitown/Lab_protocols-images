first rough cleaning of the lab
threw away stuff that was clearly not used anymore
some stuff remains (see images)

4th test of new coating method:
only the very end of strip protected with tape (see images)
--> result was good (still need to wait for drying)
tipp: use the tweezers (pinzette) to take off the tape
