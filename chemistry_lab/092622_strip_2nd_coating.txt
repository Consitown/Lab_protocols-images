refilled with 2 ml Toluene
coated the strip the 2nd time at 23.9 Â°C
new refill height: 21.3 cm

notes:end of strip is heavily coated --> not suited for connecting to PM's
	part of around 4 cm of strip is irregulary painted
	reasons:	strip is too long for the setup --> premature emerging in paint
			longer emersion in paint + manual withdrawl (irregular withdrawl speed)

one thing to do before next painting process: exactly measure how much should be emersed in paint
