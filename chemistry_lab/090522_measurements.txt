trial-cylinder measurements:
8 small ones: length 21 cm
1 big one: length 29.9 cm 
uniformly 6 mm in diameter

trial-cylinder coating:
height of evap after refill: no refill (last height on 08/25/22: 21.7 cm)
immersion depth: not done
height of evap when cylinders immersed: not done
height of evap after coating: not done

normal cylinder measurements:
length: 21 cm
diameter: 6 mm

- could not immerse cylinders in evap, since the scaffholding is not yet ready. The 3 threads (Gewinde) are coated --> not possible to
  fix in place. Need more Toluene to dissolve the residue of evap of the other, more suitable, scaffholdings.

Volume of immersed cylinders: pi*(0.6/2)^2*(21-1)*8=45.23893421169302 cm^3 (basically 47.5 cm^3)
(-1 because of the strip)
Volume of evap: pi*(11.52/2)^2*21.7=2261.801946 cm^3
Volume of plateau: pi*(5.3/2)^2*1.7=37.5 cm^3
