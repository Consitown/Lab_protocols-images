	- 0.767 g Bis-MSB (0.781 g in additional beaker)
	- 1.54 g p-Therphenyl (1.586 g in additional beaker)
amount of Toluene after solving Paraloid: 399.8 g
remaining Bis-MSB/p-Therphenyl in beaker: 0.008 g / 0.056 g

filled new paint into the tube (after lunch)
new filling height for standard paint: max - 8.6cm = 43 - 8.6 = 34.4 cm
