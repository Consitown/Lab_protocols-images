coating of the new strip for Christophe
- dimensions of the strip: 5 cm x 0.5 cm x 32 cm (made a image of pure strip after cleaning)
32 cm length: 30 cm for coating, 2 cm for displacement + holding (manual immersion is suggested)
cleaned strip with VE water, Burnus Anti-static plastic cleaner, pressured air
made 6 small tape pieces for isolation of the immersed end of the strip (see images)
holding (see images)
no refill of paint needed (if there was any evaporation, I couldn't measure it)
used longer tape to position the strip exactly above the paint
coated in standard paint for 80 seconds at 21.2Â°C

the vessel is not as high as writtem in the picture!!!! --> not enough paint
vessel heigth - new filling heigth = 8.7 cm (highest point of paint bulp due to kohesion)
