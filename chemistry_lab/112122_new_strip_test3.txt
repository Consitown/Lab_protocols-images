checked quality of tape-holding: few remainders after the 2 days of drying 
--> not possible to clean with VE water of anti-static plastic cleaner, bu Isoporpanol worked just fine

2nd coating of the "good" quality side
not a huge problem to wrap the tape around again
taking off tape will be difficult with the real deal, since you shouldn't touch any of the coating --> very small area to provide effetive counterforce to tape removal
result was nonetheless very good (4 time wrapping was sufficient)
