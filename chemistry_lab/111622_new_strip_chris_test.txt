testing new coating variant for a better strip for Christophe
- trying to use tape to isolate some parts from paint (interaction tape-paint is unknown)
- first: cleaning of test strip
- rebuilding of holding (see images)

one result from experience: 	apply tape after cleaning only the end part and then proceed to clean the rest
					for safety: only one tape at a time

- coating
- one "accident" - strip was not holded tight enough --> prematurely dropped into paint

result (see images):
its not really working
I get significantly less paint on taped region, but the paint is not blocked entirely
It seems that the tape gets curled when immersed in the paint --> opening for paint to go in
It seems also possible that the paint penetrates the tape via osmosis

--> next try (after drying): multiple layers of tape
