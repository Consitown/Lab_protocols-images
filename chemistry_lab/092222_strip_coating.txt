evap height: 21.35 cm --> refill 5 ml of Toluene
cleaned strip of dust with pressurized air
adjusted the holding desigh a bit (see images)
coated strip: cause of displacement, I coated around 22 cm of the strip
around 5 cm of the strip were victim of the non-ideal holding conditions --> might have layer of more irregular paint

new refill height: 21.35 cm (bulge)
coating temperature: before=24.1°C after=24.4°C

prooced to let it dry over weekend
