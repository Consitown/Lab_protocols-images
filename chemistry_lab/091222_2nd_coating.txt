as also Jakob did it: same immersion time as last time=80 s and max coating velocity
first things first: refill (to 21.5 cm):
	current height=21.5 cm --> no refill needed
cleaned ruler thoroughly
--> proceed with coating

--> coated at 24.8 Â°C (went smoothly)
--> another dry for 48 hours
new refill height=21.45 cm (the line on the ruler bulges, base at 21.4 cm)
