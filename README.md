# Lab_protocols-images
Note: There are also additional log books in the respective labs.\\
I personally handeled all this this way:\\
All parameters for the coating procedures can also be found in the chemistry lab log, but the logs/protocols here are more detailed. For the detector lab, I never bothered with digital logs/protocols, but you can find everything in the cosmics log which I made.\\
This repo also contains a lot of images which the logs refer to. The file names should speak for themselves.
